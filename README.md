## [Final Project](#final)   
 
### 🏦 Artificial Ledger Technology (User Management Authenticated by Generated QR Code) 🔒  

#### Machine Problem: 

🚀 Create an Object-Oriented `Student Record with User Management Authenticated by Generated QR Code` that allows an `administrator` to manage student records (add, view, and update student details.)

#### ✨ Features:

✨ The system should have to options to Login:

- #### Admin : Can manage student records
- #### Student : Can only view student details

#### ⛓️ Program Requirements    

##### 1. User Management

* Two roles: Admin and Student.

* Admin:
```
Username: Admin

Password: Admin@123
```
* Student:
```
Username: Student

Password: Stud321@
```

##### 2. Student Records

o Students have:

§ StudentNo

§ Department

§ Degree

§ Name

3. Encapsulation:

o Ensure all fields are private and provide public getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying them.

4. All student attributes are private.

5. Access to student data is through getter and setter methods.

6. Credentials are accessed through authentication methods.

7. Student Records will be inputted and manage by the Administrator Account
